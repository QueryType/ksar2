# ksar2
Fork of ksar - a sar grapher

Ksar2 is a standalone Java application which allows to create graphs of data generated 
by Unix/Linux sa/sar commands.

This is fork of ksar project hosted originally at sourceforce.net. Since original project 
seams to be abandoned, this fork is created to maintain and develop the application.

If you want just to run the application, download and run jar file from *distrib* directory.
